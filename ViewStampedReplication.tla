----------------------- MODULE ViewStampedReplication -----------------------
\* NOTE - All optimization are tagged with OPT#Num

\* NOTE - For ensuring weak fairness conditions by just declaring it on VRNext as below (to stop infinite stuttering), we require
\* each sub step (in VRNext) to be disabled ("not enabled") in case it has already been executed and rexecuting it will not change
\* the state.
\*      Declaration as follows - WF_vars(VRNext)
\*
\* If the sub-step is left enabled after execution, TLC will allow behaviours that stutter at this sub-step (making it difficult
\* to debug if certain states are eventually reached when adding new functionality in the spec). A workaround to avoiding this is
\* would be to declare weak fairness on each sub-step (as below), but that is cumbersome for two reasons -
\*   1. Required changing the fairness condition when new steps are added, old ones renamed/removed.
\*   2. If a sub-step has a parameters (say process id), then we have to specify WF conditions for all possible sub-steps as below.
\*
\*      Workaround declaration is as follows - \A p_id \in NumProcesses: WF_vars(sendPrepares(p_id)) /\ WF_vars(sendPrepares(p_id)) and so on...
\*
\* This trick is called the WfSimplifier in the spec to succinctly point out conditions added for exactly just this purpose.


\* TODOs -
\*   1. Test VR with flexible quorums (just for fun to check if the spec still works fine)?
\*   2. Reconfiguration protocol
\*   3. Consider using symmetry sets where ever possible
\*   4. Test with a rogue process to prove that it is easy to break correctness with byzantine failures.
\*   5. Allow state transfer (catch-up)

EXTENDS Integers, Sequences, FiniteSets, TLC

CONSTANT
    \* The total number of processes; Index of each process falls in 0..NumProcesses-1
    NumProcesses,

    \* ClientCommands is a set of distinct client commands. The specification doesn't bother to maintain a client table as
    \* it is not relevant to the correctness of the core consensus algorithm - which is to arrive at a specific order for the
    \* client commands in presence of failures.
    ClientCommands,

    \* The maximum view number any process in any bhaviour can attain (this is to restrict the allowed behaviours that TLC
    \* scans through). This can also be enforced by specifying a State Constraint when running TLC.
    MaxViewNum,

    \* Maximum number of process failures allowed in the behaviour (this is again to restrict the allowed behaviours that TLC
    \* scans through).
    MaxFailures

        This is used to check that every behaviour conforms with some intended behaviour specified by the LinearizableOrdering spec.

\*    messages from all other nodes since they are from an ealier nonce, even though using those responses would have not violateed
\*    safety. This will require another set of RECOVERYRESPONSE messages.
